# EHM Scout

An application that will take a screenshots from Eastside Hockey Manager and translate them into attribute data. This is very incomplete and at this point is
a proof of concept. If it ever advances past that point then this README will become more detailed.

# Getting Started

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Create a service account key for Google Cloud Vision API and put the .json file at `/serviceAccount.json`
3. run `yarn dev`
